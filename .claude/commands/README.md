## Workflow Examples

### Standard Development Flow

1. Make your changes
2. Run `/quick-test` frequently
3. When feature complete, run `/pre-merge`
4. Wait for CI, check with `/pr-status`
5. Request review when all checks pass

### Troubleshooting Flow

1. PR failing? Run `/pr-status` to see what's wrong
2. Fix issues locally
3. Run `/quick-test` to verify fixes
4. Push changes
5. Run `/pr-status` again

### Clean Start Flow

1. Run `/docker-clean` (with volumes)
2. Rebuild: `docker compose build`
3. Migrate: `docker compose exec web bin/rails db:migrate`
4. Run `/quick-test` to verify setup

---

## Requirements

All commands assume you have:
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Bundler installed locally
- Database services accessible

## Customization

To modify these commands, edit the `.md` files in this directory. Each command is a markdown file with:
- Description (used in Claude Code UI)
- Detailed instructions for Claude to follow
- Error handling guidance

## Tips

- Use `/pre-merge` as your final quality gate
- Run `/quick-test` often during development
- Check `/pr-status` after every push
- Clean Docker regularly with `/docker-clean`
